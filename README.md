# Colorama Hooks

In this assignment, we used a the Javascript. Math.random() function to create a color slider that changes lightness, hue, and saturation, as well as randomly generates new colors upon button click and refresh. In this project, I have added the slider for aplha which will edit the color transparency in and out revealing a patterned image background.

This project is a REACT app that utilizes hooks for the changing of state for each slider and corresponding function.
